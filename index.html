				<p>Puan Hajah Padzilah Enda Sulaiman was a fulltime housewife and mother of six sons when she founded Siti Khadijah. She is a multi-talented personality, with a vision to impart positive impact to the community through Muslimah prayer outfits and modest fashion. The story began in 2009 during her search for a telekung with the perfect fit. Realising that women deserved a telekung that fits well and was comfortable, she began drafting her telekung design. It was a revolutionary design that focusses on comfort and superior quality. </p>
				<p>Here at Siti Khadijah, we strive to create: a complete prayer outfit (telekung) that you will love. More importantly, we want to help you stay focused when performing your ibadah. Siti Khadijah was built on a desire to help followers of the faith feel equanimous in their prayer. In a world where the devout grow in numbers and where faith is a pillar of their life, we aim to be the spiritual companion of lifeâ€™s journey.</p>
